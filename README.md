# MNIST Digit Recognition
This repository contains a simple website on which the user can draw any number between 0-9 and this number is recognized in real time with the help of a so called Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The typography of the CNN is visualized as well.


The typography of the CNN looks like this:
  1. input layer (28, 28, 1)
  2. Conv2D Layer (26, 26, 32)
  3. Activation layer ReLU (26, 26, 32)
  4. Flatten Layer (21,632)
  5. Activation Layer Softmax (10)
